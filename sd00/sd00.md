## Preamble

**Hello, and welcome to your first Structured Development workshop!**

This workshop is part of a mini-course for *42* students curated by *Prof. Enrico Vicario* and *Dr. Nicolò Pollini*. Throughout this course, you'll be introduced to a programming methodology that originated in the 1960s and has since evolved in tandem with the C language.

**Structured Development** is built on three key pillars:

- **Structured Programming** *(today's focus)*: This concerns the act of writing code in a clean, readable, and maintainable way. It emphasizes avoiding common pitfalls and code smells that lead to bugs and wasted time, especially during debugging.

- **Structured Design**: Good software design means organizing your codebase so that each function has a clear, well-defined purpose. The goal is to prevent situations where small changes ripple through the entire system, forcing you to rewrite large portions of code (yes, we're looking at you, *spaghetti code*).

- **Structured Analysis**: This is the most abstract level. It involves designing the architecture of an entire software system, especially when highly complex, based on its requirements and the flow of information needed to fulfill them.

> **Remember:**  
> Code is not just written to work, it's written to be used.  
> If it's worth using, it's worth writing for someone else to read, understand, and maintain.  
> You never write code *just* for yourself.

## Introduction

**Structured Programming** is a paradigm aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and maintainability of code by using a well-defined set of control structures: sequence, selection, and repetition. Introduced in the late 1960s as a response to the chaotic and error-prone nature of unstructured code (often using goto statements), Structured Programming encourages:

- Breaking programs into small, modular functions.
- Writing code with one entry and one exit point per block (when possible).
- Designing a clear and predictable control flow, enabling *Axiomatic Reasoning*.

The goal is to make code easier to read, test, debug, and modify, laying a solid foundation for more advanced software design principles.

In the **June 13** lecture, you'll receive more in-depth information about Structured Programming. For now, this brief introduction is all you need to get started. You will get a chance to tackle them again after the lecture.

Approach the following exercises using **your own coding style**, without restrictions. You're encouraged to explore: discuss with your classmates, search online, and even use AI tools if you wish.

However, a word of caution about **Large Language Models (LLMs)** like ChatGPT, Gemini, and similar tools:

Researchers (including us) have studied [the impact of over-relying on AI in learning-driven development](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3626252.3630927), and the findings suggest that, while LLMs can boost your short-term performance, **overusing them can hinder your long-term growth**. The knowledge and skills you build now are what your future success depends on.

Here's our recommended approach:

1. **Start by solving the problem on your own.**
2. **If you get stuck, ask your peers or look for help online.**
3. **If you're still stuck, and no one can help, use LLMs to understand *how* to approach the problem**, but don't let them solve it for you, unless you're certain that solving this particular problem is not important to your learning journey.

## General Instructions

This document contains **10 C programming exercises**, arranged in **increasing order of difficulty**. While you're free to tackle them in any order, we recommend progressing sequentially to get the most out of the experience.

These exercises are **not meant to be completed in full by everyone**, so don't be discouraged if you struggle early on. This course brings together students with a wide range of experience, and the more advanced tasks are designed to challenge even seasoned programmers.

**Tomorrow, we'll release the second set of exercises (Structured Design)**. So focus on doing your best with today's set, don't get stuck trying to perfect a solution that's already good enough.

### Evaluation Criteria

Unlike in previous experiences, you will be evaluated not only on whether your solution works and meets the requirements, but also on the **reasoning behind your choices**. In fact, this is the primary focus of the evaluation. *(No pressure, though)*

Here are a few important notes:

- **Your code must compile.** Minor oversights or non-critical errors may be tolerated, as long as the core functionality is preserved.
- **You're not required to follow the 42 Norm**, but it's a good starting point if you're unsure about what constitutes clean and readable code.

> **Note:** This is the **first version** of this document, so it may contain errors or inaccuracies.  
> If you spot any issues, please let the staff know as soon as possible. Thank you!

## Submission and Peer-Evaluation

- **Create a personal repository** named:  
  `42xunifi-structured-development-2025-<your-intra-login>`  
  Share it with the staff and organize the exercises as follows:

  ```markdown
  sd00/
    ex00/
    ex01/
    ex02/
    ...
  sd01/
    ex00/
    ex01/
    ...
  sd02/
    ex00/
    ...
  ```

- **Update your repository regularly**, and make sure to **push all completed exercises before the deadline**.

- **This workshop's deadline is June 13**. Any changes made after this date **will not be considered** for assessment purposes.

- This exercise follows the **42 methodology**, so **peer-to-peer collaboration is allowed and strongly encouraged**.

- **Formal peer evaluations via Intra will not be available**, but you are still welcome to ask your peers for feedback on your work.

- **Our feedback won't be immediate**, so to help you track your progress, we recommend using **SonarQube**, a free tool that detects common pitfalls and code smells, many of which will be considered during evaluation. Here is a guide on how to set up it their cloud version.

### Setting Up SonarQube (SonarCloud) with GitHub

1. **Create a public GitHub repository** for the course, named: `42xunifi-structured-development-2025-<your-intra-login>`).
2. Go to [**SonarCloud**](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarcloud/) and click **“Start now.”**
3. Sign up using your **GitHub account**.
4. When prompted, **import an organization**. You can use `"42"` or your GitHub username.
5. **Authorize access only to selected repositories**, choose the one you created in step 1.
6. Choose a **Name** and a **Key** for your organization (your username is usually fine for both).
7. Select the **Free Plan** when prompted.
8. Click **“Create Organization.”**
9. Select the previously created repository and click **“Set Up.”**
10. For code technology, choose **“Previous version”**.
11. Click **“Create Project.”**
12. ***Profit.***
